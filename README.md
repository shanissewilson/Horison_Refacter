# Code Refactor Starter Code
This is my first attempt in refactering the code for this challenge. I mainly went in and change the font sizes, colors, and sizes of the images, so that the webpage can look appealing as well as readable to the viewer. Everything has been done all by me, mostly from the top of my head and just a few resources from Google that I will link down below. Feel free to look over this and leave any feedback! Thanks!
